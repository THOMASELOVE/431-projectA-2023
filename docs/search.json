Write a few sentences describing the transformations you considered, and why you thought this was the most promising, and why you eventually decided to use the transformed versions of your variables.\nIf you decide not to use a transformation, identify the ONE plot which was the most promising of available transformations and show that one. Write a few sentences describing the transformations you considered, and why you thought this was the most promising, and why you eventually decided to stick with the original versions of the variables.\n\n\nTips on the Transformation Assessment\nYour response will include ONE plot demonstrating a particular transformation, although you will probably fit and view several plots in order to select a final one for this work.\nFor this part of Project A, confine your search to either a logarithm, an inverse, or a square as applied to the outcome. If you want to consider one of those transformations for the predictor as well, that’s OK but not crucial. You should select the most promising transformation on the basis of a scatterplot (perhaps with a loess smooth and linear fit) after the transformation has been applied.\nYou are discouraged from using numerical summaries of fit in this section. Of course, summary statistics like \\(R^2\\) when the outcome is transformed will definitely not be comparable.\nNote that this transformation assessment is part of Analysis 1, but will not be shown in Analyses 2 or 3.

    "text": "Forty Things That Students Should Check in Their Project A Report\nThis list is not comprehensive. These aren’t the only things that Dr. Love and the TAs will be checking, and we won’t necessarily check all of them in every project. There is no 1:1 correspondence between your grade on the report (which is determined holistically) and the elements on this checklist. It is fair to say that your report will receive a better grade if these elements are complete.\n\nThe date of the project is automatically generated by R Markdown in the YAML using r Sys.Date() and appears in the format 2022-10-31 in the HTML.\nThe name(s) of the author(s) are clearly listed in the YAML and in the HTML.\nNeither warning = FALSE nor include = FALSE nor eval = FALSE is used anywhere in the project.\nAll packages are loaded near the top of the document (as opposed to partway through) and message = FALSE is used to suppress the messages created when loading packages.\nCode-folding and code download should be used, with this set to code_folding: show so that the code is visible (by default) in the HTML, as well as code-download: TRUE.\nThe option comment = NA is used in the R Markdown file - usually with knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA) - to ensure that R results in the HTML are not preceded with ##.\nThere are no warnings in the HTML document.\nThe project uses read_csv to read in the data, and show_col_types = FALSE is used to suppress the message about column specifications there.\nmessage = FALSE is used to suppress the message created when running something from the mosaic package (usually favstats) for the first time.\nThe headings and subheadings (so things like 1 and 1.1) of the entire Project A document are numbered automatically (use number_sections: TRUE in the YAML), appear in the table of contents, and contain no misspelled words.\nThe headings and first-level subheadings in the outline for Project A Analyses 1, 2, and 3 are used as they are shown in Professor Love’s sample project A.\nProfessor Love’s instructions are NOT repeated in your HTML.\nThe function summary() as applied to a tibble does not appear in your HTML.\nThe raw data (prior to filtering rows and selecting variables) is not printed or summarized or listed in your HTML.\nThe tibble is printed in its final form as part of the “Our Analytic Tibble” section, before the Codebook and Analyses.\nThe final tibble is saved to an Rds file before the Analyses and that file to which it is saved contains only letters and numbers and in particular no spaces in its name. Please submit the .Rds file to Canvas with your final report, unlike what we asked for in the Proposal.\nThe Hmisc::describe results (which follow the printing of the tibble) include all rows shown in the printed tibble, and the variable names shown there match those shown in the codebook and then used in the three Analyses (unless a transformation is used.)\nThere are no avoidable scrolling windows in the HTML document. Avoidable scrolling windows are those fixed by hitting ENTER more often in writing R code.\nThe count of counties matches up throughout the document until missingness is accounted for analytically (with either imputation or complete-case analysis).\nThe variable described in the codebook as the outcome is actually used as the outcome (perhaps after a transformation) in Analyses 1, 2 and 3.\nThe project demonstrates that all five variables of interest have been cleaned in accordance with the instructions specified here (for example, proportions are presented/interpreted as percentages.)\nAnalyses 1, 2, and 3 are done on complete cases for the outcome variables, and the number of rows used in each Analysis matches up with the previously described county counts, less the counties with missing values on the variables used in that analysis if complete cases are used, and imputation is appropriately performed if a decision is made to use it.\nThe three main functions from the broom package: tidy, glance and augment are used appropriately in the Analyses.\nThe predictor used in Analysis 1 was identified as a quantitative predictor in the codebook, and has at least 15 distinct values in the final tibble.\nThe predictor used in Analysis 2 was created as a categorical predictor correctly in the data development section, using the number of levels and names for those levels that are used in Analysis 2.\nThe order of levels for the predictor in Analysis 2 is appropriate (for binary predictors, any order is fine if it is clear, for an ordered multi-category variable, the order matters.)\nThe categorical predictor in Analysis 2 shows the same levels as are specified in the codebook.\nIf a multi-categorical predictor is used in Analysis 2, it is included as a factor. (If a binary predictor is used, then either a 1-0 or factor representation is OK.)\nThe choice of baseline category for the predictor in Analysis 2 is explicitly stated in the description of Analysis 2 variables and matches what the analysis actually generates.\nOhio is chosen as the baseline state for Analysis 3.\nThe quantitative predictor in Analysis 3 was identified as a quantitative predictor in the codebook.\nIn Analysis 1, there is a plot to compare the data without a transformation to the data with the chosen (or best alternative) transformation.\nTransformation decisions are motivated by patterns shown in the visualizations, without reference to numerical summaries like R-square that are inappropriate for that task.\nFor each of the three Analyses, the research question is stated clearly, is grammatically correct, and ends with a question mark.\nFor each of the three Analyses, a clearly written answer to the research question is provided in the first paragraph of the Conclusions section, and is motivated by the analysis you did in a clear way. This is followed by a second paragraph that describes meaningful limitations of that Analysis. (Note that it’s not a good idea to suggest limitations that you could fix with the tools you have - instead, apply those tools and build a better Analysis.)\nThe project title contains no misspelled words and reflects what is actually studied in the Analyses (or at least in one of the Analyses.) Do not use the terms “Project” or “Project A” or “431” in your title. You can use “CHR-2022” as the abbreviation in your title for “County Health Rankings, 2022.” Keep your title to 80 characters. Subtitles are permitted if desired.\nYour residual analysis / prediction analysis includes all things required in the outline, which includes but is not limited to:\n\nAn appropriate set of residual plots (for Analyses 1 and 3) or plot (for Analysis 2) with a summary description of your conclusions in complete sentences.\nYour model’s predictions for Cuyahoga County, OH and a comparison of that prediction to the observed value for that county on the original scale.\nIdentification of two counties (by name and state) where the model is least successful at predicting the outcome.\n\nIf the outcome is transformed, then all of the following are true.\n\nThe coefficients of the regression model are interpreted correctly in terms of the transformed outcome. If both the outcome and a predictor are transformed, the interpretation of the relevant coefficient estimates describes change in the transformed outcome as a function of a change in the transformed predictor.\nThe project describes what is being predicted as, for example, the log of (outcome as measured in units) rather than attributing units directly to log(outcome).\nWhen the model is used to predict the outcome for individual counties, this includes back-conversion to the original outcome scale.\nIn Analysis 1, when you specify the Pearson correlation, that should be the correlation after transformation(s) so that the R-squared value reported for your model is the square of the Pearson correlation you report.\nIf the outcome is transformed in Analysis 1, the same transformation is used in Analyses 2 and 3, or there is a meaningful explanation (accompanied by a plot) to explain why they switched. It’s 100% fine to use a transformation in one Analysis that is different than the transformation selected in another Analysis, but this should be justified with an appropriate plot and description of why the choice was made.\n\nThe session information is printed, in a section of its own that appears in the Table of Contents and is the last part of the document.\nIf you are working with a partner, one of you submits the Rmd, HTML and video files to Canvas, and the other partner submits a one-page note to Canvas stating who their partner is and that their partner will submit the materials for their project team. Everyone (including both members of each team) should fill out the self-evaluation form after the Rmd, HTML and video files are posted to Canvas.\n\nGood luck!"

You will want to take the reciprocal (1/raw value) to rescale the results in terms of population per provider, which should ease interpretation.\n\nNote that after rescaling by taking the reciprocal, you may see some counties with infinite ratios, which should then be changed to missing values.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nVariable Description\nCode\nVariable Description\n\n\n\n\nv004\nPrimary care physicians\nv088\nDentists\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables that should be rescaled\nTwo of the variables you might choose should be rescaled by division so as to more closely match the scales of other variables you’ll study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nVariable Description\nWhat to do?\n\n\n\n\nv001\nPremature death\nDivide by 100 to represent losses per 1000 population\n\n\nv063\nMedian household income\nDivide by 1000 to represent income in thousands of dollars\n\n\n\n\nThe variable v001 is very tempting to use an outcome. That’s OK, but be sure to consider the use of either v127 or v147 as well as an outcome if mortality interests you. Do not use v001, v127 and v147 in the same Analysis.\n\n\n\nVariables that are Proportions should be converted to Percentages\nEach of the variables listed below are proportions (between 0 and 1). Before you use them in any analyses, multiply them by 100 in your data development (using the mutate function) to turn their values into percentages (between 0 and 100.) We’re doing this to ease your interpretation of these variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nVariable Description\nCode\nVariable Description\n\n\n\n\nv002\nPoor or fair health\nv083\nLimited access to healthy foods\n\n\nv009\nAdult smoking\nv085\nUninsured\n\n\nv011\nAdult obesity\nv126\nProportion Non-Hispanic White (see note below)\n\n\nv023\nUnemployment\nv132\nAccess to exercise opportunities\n\n\nv037\nLow birthweight\nv134\nProportion of driving deaths with alcohol involvement\n\n\nv049\nExcessive drinking\nv136\nSevere housing problems\n\n\nv050\nMammography screening\nv139\nFood insecurity\n\n\nv053\nProportion ages 65 and older\nv143\nInsufficient sleep\n\n\nv057\nProportion Female\nv154\nSevere housing cost burden\n\n\nv058\nProportion Rural\nv155\nFlu vaccinations\n\n\nv059\nProportion not proficient in English\nv166\nBroadband access\n\n\nv060\nDiabetes prevalence\nv168\nHigh school completion\n\n\nv067\nDriving alone to work\nv177\nVoter turnout\n\n\nv070\nPhysical inactivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding variable v126: A serious look at the impact of race/ethnicity is beyond the scope of Project A. If you are interested in studying race and ethnicity and their impact on a health outcome, we suggest using v126 to incorporate this dimension as a predictor (or its inverse, 1 - v126), rather than including any other race/ethnicity variables. This is because there’s more variation in the v126 data across the reported counties.\n\n\n\nVariables that should be OK as is\nThe variables listed below should be useful as they are. Most of them are ratios, although a few are averages or indexes. The main issue for these variables is correctly specifying the units of measurement (note that the indexes don’t have units.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nVariable Description\nCode\nVariable Description\n\n\n\n\nv005\nPreventable hospital stays\nv133\nFood environment index\n\n\nv036\nPoor physical health days\nv135\nInjury deaths\n\n\nv042\nPoor mental health days\nv140\nSocial associations\n\n\nv044\nIncome inequality\nv147\nLife expectancy\n\n\nv045\nSexually transmitted infections\nv151\nGender pay gap\n\n\nv125\nAir pollution - particulate matter\nv156\nTraffic volume\n\n\nv127\nPremature age-adjusted mortality\nv169\nSchool funding adequacy (gap measured in dollars per pupil)\n\n\n\n\nIf you are considering v127 or v147, please read my note about variable v001 under the “Variables that should be rescaled” table earlier."

Write a few sentences describing the transformations you considered, and why you thought this was the most promising, and why you eventually decided to use the transformed versions of your variables.\nIf you decide not to use a transformation, identify the ONE plot which was the most promising of available transformations and show that one. Write a few sentences describing the transformations you considered, and why you thought this was the most promising, and why you eventually decided to stick with the original versions of the variables.\n\n\nGuidance from Dr. Love on the Transformation Assessment\nYour response will include ONE plot demonstrating a particular transformation, although you will probably fit and view several plots in order to select a final one for this work.\nFor this part of Project A, confine your search to either a logarithm, an inverse, or a square as applied to the outcome. If you want to consider one of those transformations for the predictor as well, that’s OK but not crucial. You should select the most promising transformation on the basis of a scatterplot (perhaps with a loess smooth and linear fit) after the transformation has been applied.\nYou are discouraged from using numerical summaries of fit in this section. Of course, summary statistics like \\(R^2\\) when the outcome is transformed will definitely not be comparable.\nNote that this transformation assessment is part of Analysis 1, but will not be shown in Analyses 2 or 3. Feel free to use the transformation (of the outcome) that you select in Analysis 1 for the other two Analyses, if you like."
