    "text": "This material is under revision. Please ignore it for now, until new material is posted.\nUsing the tibble you’ve developed following the instructions on the Data and Proposal pages, you will then create the remainder of your report by performing the analytic tasks specified below.\nAll three of these tasks should include R code that creates the information you need, and complete English sentences that interpret those results.\nDr. Love has provided a detailed outline for each of these Analyses as part of the Examples & Tips page. You’ll find that outline incorporated into the descriptions below, too.\n\nAnalysis 1: Simple Linear Regression Model\nProvide evidence regarding the question of how well variable 1 can be predicted using one of the other quantitative variables (your choice of either variable 2 or variable 3). This should include a report on the effectiveness of a simple linear regression model, and an appropriate plot of the relationship. Important steps to include in your analytic report include:\n\nAt the start, a careful statement of the research question you are trying to answer with this analysis. At the end, a clear and appropriate response to that question, with a clear description of the limitations of your work. Most of the time, one model won’t let you come to a strong conclusion about a question of interest, and it is your job to accurately present what information can be specified as a result of the model, without overstating your conclusions. This (the specification of your research question and your response) is the most important part of the analysis.\nA visualization of the relationship between the outcome (Y-axis) and the predictor (X-axis) and a written description of what you learn about the association (which should include its direction, shape and strength along with identification of any substantial outliers). The addition of a loess smooth and/or a fit line to the plot should be important.\nA specification of any transformations you choose to apply to the X or Y variable in order to obtain a better fit with a simple linear regression, along with some justification for the choice (or for the decision not to apply a transformation.)\nA specification of the actual prediction equation created by the model, and an interpretation of what the coefficients mean, and how they should be interpreted in light of their estimated standard errors.\nA specification of summary measures of goodness of fit, at a minimum the residual standard deviation (sigma) and the r-squared value. The quality of fit is not a consideration in the grading of this work.\nIdentification of the two counties (by name and state) where the model is least successful at predicting the outcome.\n\n\nThe Outline for Analysis 1\nThe outline Dr. Love has prepared for Analysis 1 includes the following subsections. See that outline for more details in terms of what needs to go where, and additional guidance to help you complete the project effectively.\n\nThe Variables\nResearch Question\nVisualizing the Data\nTransformation Assessment\nThe Fitted Model\nResidual Analysis\nConclusions and Limitations\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis 2: Comparing Groups on a Quantitative Outcome using Independent Samples\nProvide evidence regarding the question of how well your variable 1 can be predicted using one of your categorical variables (you may select either the binary (variable 4) or the multi-categorical (variable 5) here.) This should include a report on the effectiveness of the resulting model following the suggestions from the first task, and a key part of that report will be an appropriate, attractive and well-labeled plot of the relationship between your quantitative and categorical variable. Consider a transformation of the quantitative outcome should that prove useful, and be sure to provide evidence regarding the impact of the assumptions of a linear model on your conclusions.\nYour report should include, at a minimum:\n\nAt the start, a careful statement of the research question you are trying to answer with this analysis.

This should include a report on the effectiveness of the resulting model following the suggestions from the first task, and this must include (of course) an attractive, well-labeled and appropriate plot of the relationship that shows the impact of the state and helps us understand the inter-relationship of the three variables under study.\nYour work on Analysis 3 should follow a similar path to the first two analyses, with a careful description of what’s happening in the model, and visualizations to help us understand what you’ve learned from the data. Specification of the prediction model, its goodness of fit and identification of outliers are all relevant here, as well, and your final description of the work should demonstrate a coherent and clear understanding of what you’ve done.\nAs in Analyses 1 and 2, the most important part of this Analysis is to provide, at the start, a careful statement of the research question you are trying to answer with this analysis, followed at the end by a clear and appropriate response to that question, with a clear description of the limitations of your work.\n\nThe Outline for Analysis 3\nThe outline Dr. Love has prepared for Analysis 3 includes the following subsections.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Forty Things That Students Should Check in Their Project A Report\nThis list is not comprehensive. These aren’t the only things that Dr. Love and the TAs will be checking, and we won’t necessarily check all of them in every project. There is no 1:1 correspondence between your grade on the report (which is determined holistically) and the elements on this checklist. It is fair to say that your report will receive a better grade if these elements are complete.\n\nThe date of the project is automatically generated by R Markdown in the YAML using r Sys.Date() and appears in the format 2022-10-31 in the HTML.\nThe name(s) of the author(s) are clearly listed in the YAML and in the HTML.\nNeither warning = FALSE nor include = FALSE nor eval = FALSE is used anywhere in the project.\nAll packages are loaded near the top of the document (as opposed to partway through) and message = FALSE is used to suppress the messages created when loading packages.\nCode-folding and code download should be used, with this set to code_folding: show so that the code is visible (by default) in the HTML, as well as code-download: TRUE.\nThe option comment = NA is used in the R Markdown file - usually with knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA) - to ensure that R results in the HTML are not preceded with ##.\nThere are no warnings in the HTML document.\nThe project uses read_csv to read in the data, and show_col_types = FALSE is used to suppress the message about column specifications there.\nmessage = FALSE is used to suppress the message created when running something from the mosaic package (usually favstats) for the first time.\nThe headings and subheadings (so things like 1 and 1.1) of the entire Project A document are numbered automatically (use number_sections: TRUE in the YAML), appear in the table of contents, and contain no misspelled words.\nThe headings and first-level subheadings in the outline for Project A Analyses 1, 2, and 3 are used as they are shown in Professor Love’s sample project A.\nProfessor Love’s instructions are NOT repeated in your HTML.\nThe function summary() as applied to a tibble does not appear in your HTML.\nThe raw data (prior to filtering rows and selecting variables) is not printed or summarized or listed in your HTML.\nThe tibble is printed in its final form as part of the “Our Analytic Tibble” section, before the Codebook and Analyses.\nThe final tibble is saved to an Rds file before the Analyses and that file to which it is saved contains only letters and numbers and in particular no spaces in its name. Please submit the .Rds file to Canvas with your final report, unlike what we asked for in the Proposal.\nThe Hmisc::describe results (which follow the printing of the tibble) include all rows shown in the printed tibble, and the variable names shown there match those shown in the codebook and then used in the three Analyses (unless a transformation is used.)\nThere are no avoidable scrolling windows in the HTML document. Avoidable scrolling windows are those fixed by hitting ENTER more often in writing R code.\nThe count of counties matches up throughout the document until missingness is accounted for analytically (with either imputation or complete-case analysis).\nThe variable described in the codebook as the outcome is actually used as the outcome (perhaps after a transformation) in Analyses 1, 2 and 3.\nThe project demonstrates that all five variables of interest have been cleaned in accordance with the instructions specified here (for example, proportions are presented/interpreted as percentages.)\nAnalyses 1, 2, and 3 are done on complete cases for the outcome variables, and the number of rows used in each Analysis matches up with the previously described county counts, less the counties with missing values on the variables used in that analysis if complete cases are used, and imputation is appropriately performed if a decision is made to use it.\nThe three main functions from the broom package: tidy, glance and augment are used appropriately in the Analyses.\nThe predictor used in Analysis 1 was identified as a quantitative predictor in the codebook, and has at least 15 distinct values in the final tibble.\nThe predictor used in Analysis 2 was created as a categorical predictor correctly in the data development section, using the number of levels and names for those levels that are used in Analysis 2.\nThe order of levels for the predictor in Analysis 2 is appropriate (for binary predictors, any order is fine if it is clear, for an ordered multi-category variable, the order matters.)\nThe categorical predictor in Analysis 2 shows the same levels as are specified in the codebook.\nIf a multi-categorical predictor is used in Analysis 2, it is included as a factor. (If a binary predictor is used, then either a 1-0 or factor representation is OK.)\nThe choice of baseline category for the predictor in Analysis 2 is explicitly stated in the description of Analysis 2 variables and matches what the analysis actually generates.\nOhio is chosen as the baseline state for Analysis 3.\nThe quantitative predictor in Analysis 3 was identified as a quantitative predictor in the codebook.\nIn Analysis 1, there is a plot to compare the data without a transformation to the data with the chosen (or best alternative) transformation.\nTransformation decisions are motivated by patterns shown in the visualizations, without reference to numerical summaries like R-square that are inappropriate for that task.\nFor each of the three Analyses, the research question is stated clearly, is grammatically correct, and ends with a question mark.\nFor each of the three Analyses, a clearly written answer to the research question is provided in the first paragraph of the Conclusions section, and is motivated by the analysis you did in a clear way. This is followed by a second paragraph that describes meaningful limitations of that Analysis. (Note that it’s not a good idea to suggest limitations that you could fix with the tools you have - instead, apply those tools and build a better Analysis.)\nThe project title contains no misspelled words and reflects what is actually studied in the Analyses (or at least in one of the Analyses.) Do not use the terms “Project” or “Project A” or “431” in your title. You can use “CHR-2022” as the abbreviation in your title for “County Health Rankings, 2022.” Keep your title to 80 characters. Subtitles are permitted if desired.\nYour residual analysis / prediction analysis includes all things required in the outline, which includes but is not limited to:\n\nAn appropriate set of residual plots (for Analyses 1 and 3) or plot (for Analysis 2) with a summary description of your conclusions in complete sentences.\nYour model’s predictions for Cuyahoga County, OH and a comparison of that prediction to the observed value for that county on the original scale.\nIdentification of two counties (by name and state) where the model is least successful at predicting the outcome.\n\nIf the outcome is transformed, then all of the following are true.\n\nThe coefficients of the regression model are interpreted correctly in terms of the transformed outcome. If both the outcome and a predictor are transformed, the interpretation of the relevant coefficient estimates describes change in the transformed outcome as a function of a change in the transformed predictor.\nThe project describes what is being predicted as, for example, the log of (outcome as measured in units) rather than attributing units directly to log(outcome).\nWhen the model is used to predict the outcome for individual counties, this includes back-conversion to the original outcome scale.\nIn Analysis 1, when you specify the Pearson correlation, that should be the correlation after transformation(s) so that the R-squared value reported for your model is the square of the Pearson correlation you report.\nIf the outcome is transformed in Analysis 1, the same transformation is used in Analyses 2 and 3, or there is a meaningful explanation (accompanied by a plot) to explain why they switched. It’s 100% fine to use a transformation in one Analysis that is different than the transformation selected in another Analysis, but this should be justified with an appropriate plot and description of why the choice was made.\n\nThe session information is printed, in a section of its own that appears in the Table of Contents and is the last part of the document.\nIf you are working with a partner, one of you submits the Rmd, HTML and video files to Canvas, and the other partner submits a one-page note to Canvas stating who their partner is and that their partner will submit the materials for their project team. Everyone (including both members of each team) should fill out the self-evaluation form after the Rmd, HTML and video files are posted to Canvas.\n\nGood luck!"

Some variables in that set of 50 will lead to more straightforward analyses than others.\nEach variable you select should be of some interest to you on its own, in terms of either providing a health outcome of interest, or potentially providing useful information about a feature of the county that might relate to that health outcome. Your five selected quantitative variables, selected by you from the 50 available “raw value” CHR variables, will need be treated as follows:\n\n\nvariable 1 will be treated as quantitative, and as an outcome of interest\ntwo others (variables 2 and 3) will be treated as quantitative predictors of interest for variable 1\n\nEach of your quantitative variables (1, 2 and 3) must have at least 15 distinct values within your final tibble.\n\nvariable 4 will be categorized into 2 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive levels to create a binary categorical variable of interest in predicting variable 1 (this is a terrible idea in practical work.)\n\nExactly one of the variables in the data (v124 about drinking water violations) is already a binary (1 = Yes, 0 = No) variable (all other variables are quantitative.) You are permitted to use v124 as your variable 4, if you like. v124 may not be used as anything other than variable 4 in your work.\n\nvariable 5 will be categorized into 3-5 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive levels to create a multi-categorical variable of interest in predicting variable 1 (this is almost as bad as what we’ll do to variable 4 in practical work)\nthe state will serve as another multi-categorical (with 4-6 categories) predictor of variable 1, so this will also be part of your tibble\n\n\nEach of the five variables you select must have data for at least 75% of the counties in each state you plan to study. This is something you will have to check on, in R, and you’ll have to present the code, and demonstrate with complete English sentences that you’ve verified this. The use of a tool (or more than one) from the naniar package to do this checking is encouraged.\nThe descriptions provided in these instructions associated with each variable are available as the first (deleted in R) row in the .csv file, and are also specified in the 2023 CHR Analytic Data Documentation PDF file.\nAcross your complete set of 6 selected states, the raw versions of each of your five selected variables must have at least ten distinct non-missing values. You’ll need to show R code to do this checking (the best choice is often Hmisc::describe() since you’ll run that anyway), and you’ll need to demonstrate with a complete English sentence or two that you have checked this to be true."

You should also submit your main data file (chr_2022_YOURNAME.Rds).\n\nNEW Dr. Love has provided a Full Project A Sample, actually four of them (each using a different theme, but otherwise identical) which includes some revised proposal materials, followed by the outline for the analyses. A list of all of the changes from the “proposal” example to this “full project” example is provided here. The bottom line is that, ideally, everyone will now have the same 9 Sections in this revised Sample Project in their Final Project A, as indicated in the Full Project A Sample.\n\nPreliminaries\nData Development\nOur Analytic Tibble\nCodebook\nBiggest Challenge\nAnalysis 1\nAnalysis 2\nAnalysis 3\nSession Information\n\nNote that there is a checklist for the final report as part of the Examples & Tips page that includes many things we’ll be looking for in grading. It’s well worth your time to review the checklist before submitting your work.\n\nThe Video You will produce a video in mp4 format of no more than 3 minutes in length if you’re working alone, and of no more than 5 minutes in length between you if you are working in a pair. In this video, you will describe what you believe to be the most important findings for your choice of two of the three analytic tasks you have completed, while explaining your process of cleaning and managing the data as much as you believe is necessary for people to understand and evaluate your conclusions.\n\nIf you are working alone on the project, begin your presentation by introducing yourself and describing your sample (which states you used and specifying the research questions you’ll be addressing in your discussion.)\nIf you are working in a pair, each of you will present one of the two analyses, either in two separate videos (which combined are no more than 5 minutes long) or in one video. In either case, introduce yourself at the start of your portion of the video, and specify the states you used (even though you and your partner will be using the same states) and the research question you’ll be addressing.\nYour video must include your face (so recording in Zoom is preferable) and must share graphs and results taken from the report you build.\nAll videos should include a clear statement of the research questions for any analyses presented, and justify the responses to those questions with results from the analyses.\nThe video must stand on its own, in the sense that it must be completely understandable to someone who has not read your report, but who is generally familiar with County Health Rankings and its measurements. You need to tell us everything we need to know to evaluate your claims, and no more.\n\nThe Self-Evaluation Once you have submitted the other two elements of your project, you will each (whether working alone or with a partner) submit a brief self-evaluation via this Google Form. The form should take about 10 minutes to complete.\n\nIf you’re curious, the form asks you to address multiple issues related to the Project in multiple-choice questions. There are also two little essays that we’ll ask for, which should be written independently from your partner (if you have one).\n\nYou will summarize the key finding of your Project A study in your own well-chosen words (where your response should be in the neighborhood of 75 words, describing one key finding, which might come from any of your three analyses.)\nAlso, you will tell us what the most important piece of advice is that you wished you’d heard when you began Project A (and we’d like at least 25 words here).\n\n\n\nAll three elements are due at the end of October, specifically at the time and date indicated on the Course Calendar.\n\n\n\nProject A is graded on a scale from 0 to 100, theoretically, although I expect the highest grade to be close to 95. Dr. Love works with the TAs to provide feedback and grade the projects, but the final Project A grade is determined solely by him.\nA successful Proposal is a mandatory part of Project A, and is worth 25 points as part of the Project A grade.\nThe Report is worth 35 points. It is unlikely that anyone will score above 33 points, which is the planned score for a completely accurate and polished report. Most scores will likely fall between 23 and 32 points on this element.\n\nThe most important parts of the Report are accurate (and effectively presented) data development, accurate (and effectively presented) analyses, and the appropriateness of your research questions and your responses to them in light of your analyses.\nMost of the feedback you will receive on your Project A report will relate to specific grading criteria and a rubric that will be evaluated (mostly) by the teaching assistants. The checklist we used to help build the rubric is available to you as part of the Examples & Hints page.\n\nThe Video is worth 30 points. It is unlikely that anyone will score above 28 points, which is the planned score for a very strong presentation, which is clear to see and hear and which is effective. Most scores will likely fall between 20 and 27 points on this element.\n\nAll videos should include a clear statement of the research questions for any analyses presented, and justify the responses to those questions with results from the analyses.\nMost of the comments Professor Love builds in response to your Project A will relate to the Video. Do not treat it lightly. It is a vital part of the work, despite its short length.\n\nThe Self-Evaluation is worth 10 points. People who complete each question on the self-evaluation thoughtfully and on time will receive the full 10 points.\n\nOverall, a project score of 89 or higher is regarded as an A, and a score of 70 to 84 is regarded as a B, with scores between 85 and 88 falling somewhere in between. Project grading is set up to generate a median score near 85.\n\n\n\nTo improve your grade, perform the elements of the data science cycle (ingestion, tidying, transforming, visualizing, modeling and communicating) more effectively. Presenting work that isn’t relevant to addressing the issues in question will not help your grade. Also, rehearse your video and make sure you present clearly and understandably throughout the (admittedly short) presentation. Make clear choices about what to include - that’s key. Do not just show us everything you did.\nA stronger grade will be associated with doing the tasks we’ve discussed more effectively. Adding a lot of additional and unnecessary analyses/work without editing down to the important issues will not improve your grade, but rather have the opposite effect. We want to see polished, accurate, clear work. Making things clearer is the hardest thing to do, and so it’s the thing that impresses us most."

    "text": "You will submit a proposal document to Canvas (both in R Markdown and HTML) providing the answers to a series of questions related to your Data Development work.\n\nYou will need to have completed all seven Tasks listed on the Data page in order to finish the proposal, but none of the work described on the Analysis page.\nYou will also need to have come up with a meaningful title: do not use the terms “Project” or “Project A” or “431” in your title. You can use “CHR-2022” as the abbreviation in your title for “County Health Rankings, 2022.” Your title should be no longer than 80 characters.\nAll of the work needed in this proposal can be accomplished in September, and doing so will help you with Quiz 1.\nTo encourage an early start, proposals submitted to Canvas prior to Monday 2021-10-03 at noon will be reviewed quickly by Dr. Love and the TAs, and if a redo is required, you’ll hear back quickly enough that you should be able to accomplish it before the final proposal deadline, and thus still have a chance to earn full credit.\nDr. Love created a Sample Project A proposal which should serve as your template for writing the proposal.\n\n\n\nYour project proposal requires you to create the tibble you plan to use and then send (via Canvas) an R Markdown file and HTML result that contains these five elements:\n\nA sentence or two (or small table) specifying the 4-6 states you chose, and the number of counties you are studying in total and within each state. The codebook you built in Task 6 of the Data work is appropriate here. In an additional sentence or two, provide some motivation for why you chose those states.\nA list of the five variables (including their original raw names and your renamed versions) you are studying, with a clear indication of the cutpoints you chose to create the binary categories out of variable 4 and the multiple categories out of variable 5. The codebook you built in Task 6 of the Data work is appropriate here. For each variable, provide a sentence describing your motivation for why this variable was interesting to you.\nA print-out of your cleaned up chr_2022 tibble, to prove it is a tibble, with 11 columns (variables) and 200-400 rows (counties). No writing is required here - just the result of the code.\nThe Hmisc::describe result for your chr_2022 tibble. As in element 3, code alone is sufficient for this element.\nIn a paragraph, describe the most challenging (or difficult) part of completing the work so far, and how you were able to overcome whatever it was that was difficult.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Love has completed an R Markdown file and compiled it into an HTML result which you can view now, and which he strongly encourages you to use in developing your own proposal. The most important recommendation we have is to use this file as a starting point for your own data and proposal development.\nThe files may be found in our Github Repository\n\nDr. Love’s R Markdown file is a strong starting point for the development of your proposal.\n\nRemember to click Raw if you want to download the R Markdown file from that link.\nThis file is also part of the 431-data repository we’ve used for labs and other data and code, so you can also get it from there.\n\nThe resulting HTML file can be viewed at https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projA-sample-proposal-431-2022, which may be easier for you to read and will also show you what your final result should look like.\n\n\n\n\nYour proposal (R Markdown and HTML file) should be submitted to Canvas.\nBe sure that your proposal includes your name (names if you are working with a partner) as the author in R Markdown.\nIf you are working with a partner, exactly one of you should submit the materials to Canvas, and the other partner should submit a text document (Word or PDF is fine) to Canvas that reads: “My name is [YOUR NAME]. I am working on Project A with [INSERT FULL NAME OF YOUR PARTNER], and they will submit the materials for the proposal.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the deadline, the TAs and Dr. Love will review your submissions quickly to ensure that your proposed plan meets the requirements for this project, and either approve the plan, or request changes.\nIf changes are requested, you’ll have a very short time window (at most 24 hours) to make those changes and resubmit until your plan is, eventually, approved.\nSuccessful completion of the proposal by the deadline will receive full credit (25 points.)\n\nProposals that require revisions after the deadline will lose 10% of the possible credit for each revision.\n\nPlease meet the deadline, and don’t wait until the last minute to do the work.\n\nTo encourage an early start, proposals submitted prior to Monday 2021-10-03 at noon will be reviewed quickly by Dr. Love and the TAs, and if a redo is required, you’ll hear back quickly enough that you should be able to accomplish it before the final proposal deadline, and thus still have a chance to earn full credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe complete proposal is submitted on time.\n\nOn time for the initial submission means R Markdown and HTML on Canvas by the deadline on the Course Calendar. If it’s late, it will lose credit for that (2.5 points out of 25), and be reviewed last.\nIf you worked with a partner, both names are in the author section of the R Markdown and HTML submitted by one of you, while the other submitted a note to Canvas meeting the specifications described in the Project A instructions.\nWhen we run the R Markdown file, does it produce the HTML file without errors? (Note: warnings or messages are OK at this stage, but it has to work.)\n\nThe YAML in the R Markdown file produces what we want in the HTML\n\nThere’s a real title that does not include Project A or Proposal and that is correctly spelled, and fits in the available space in the HTML.\nThe author name(s) appears in the HTML correctly.\nThe date is properly formatted in the HTML (achieve this most easily by using the r Sys.Date() command within the date section of the YAML as Dr. Love does in his work.)\nThere is a table of contents (doesn’t have to float, although we prefer this) which appears in the HTML and has section names that are appropriately and automatically numbered.\n\nTo achieve this, use number_sections: TRUE in the YAML.\n\nThe easiest approach to accomplish all of this is to use the readthedown template as Dr. Love did in the Example.\n\nThe project ingests the data properly.\n\nEliminating the correct row (in any way that works), and\nUsing read_csv() to read in the data, thus creating a tibble\n\nAll section headings are correctly numbered and formatted, and describe effectively the contents of the material contained in that section.\n\nReusing Dr. Love’s headings from the example proposal is a good option, but it’s OK if you want to take a different approach, so long as we can find everything.\nAgain, you need to be using toc: TRUE and number_sections: TRUE in your YAML if you are building an html_document and not using the readthedown template that Dr. Love used in his example.\nIf you’re using the readthedown template, then you need number_sections: TRUE, but not toc:TRUE since that will be done automatically by the readthedown template.\n\nYou have an attractively formatted, readable codebook that looks nice in your HTML.\n\nThe example proposal provides an example, but you can come up with something better if you like. It must be run within R Markdown though - you cannot submit an image instead of getting the codebook through code.\n\nWhich states were chosen is clear, and there is a sentence about why they were chosen.\n\nThere must be 4-6 states, including Ohio\nThis must lead to 200-400 counties, and this number must be clear from the document (both the number of rows in the final tibble and in writing.)\nYou should not drop any counties from any of the states you selected in the development of your tibble.\n\nYour selected five variables are clear, and there is information about what the variables mean and why you chose them, and the role they will play in your eventual analyses\n\nYou clearly specify which of your 5 variables is the outcome\nYou clearly specify which variable will be treated as a binary categorical variable, and which will be treated as a multi-categorical variable, specifying how many categories will be used, and why you made the choices you did about splitting those variables into categories.\nFor each of your quantitative variables (outcome and the two predictors) you specify their units in appropriate language drawn from the measure specifications at County Health Rankings.\nYou specify all variables using the name you will use in your final tibble, the vXXX code from the original data, and show that you have some understanding of what the variable means, how it was collected and why it is important in your sentences surrounding your codebook.\nYou have eleven variables in total in your tibble.\n\nThe results of your missingness check and your # of distinct values check are clear, and meet the specifications described in the instructions.\n\nYou’ve written a sentence (at least) in response to the results of each check that makes sense.\n\nYou’ve printed your final tibble by typing in its name, and it appears as a tibble.\nHmisc::describe results for your final tibble including 11 variables, with minimum and maximum values that make sense, and that show the correct number of counties and states.\nYour response to question 5 is a paragraph (or more) written in English, with attention paid to grammar, syntax and spelling.\n\nIt is clear to us what your biggest issue was, and how you tried to address it.\n\nThere is a Session Information section at the end of the document.\n\nThis should indicate that R version 4.2.1. or later is used.\n\nYou don’t have more than 3 spelling, typographical or grammatical errors in the document as a whole that we catch.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Love and the TAs will review your proposal and either ACCEPT it or ask for a REDO.\n\nACCEPT means you’re done, and should move on the rest of Project A, perhaps while making some small changes that we request of you in your submission on Canvas.\nREDO means you’ll need to fix the problems we’ve identified (plus make sure you’ve done all of the things on this checklist) and resubmit by the deadline we give you.\n\nIf your proposal is accepted on the initial submission and was on time, you’ll receive 25 points.\nIf your proposal is accepted on the first REDO (submission 2), you’ll receive 22.5 points.\nIf your proposal is accepted on the second REDO (submission 3), you’ll receive 20 points.\nWe hope we won’t have to go further than 3 attempts for anyone.\n\n\nIf you don’t have some feature that we “prefer” we may mention this and ask you to fix it in the final version of the complete Project A, but that alone wouldn’t necessitate a REDO."

The most important recommendation we have is to use this file as a starting point for your own data and proposal development.\nThe files may be found in our Github Repository\n\nDr. Love’s R Markdown file is a strong starting point for the development of your proposal.\n\nRemember to click Raw if you want to download the R Markdown file from that link.\nThis file is also part of the 431-data repository we’ve used for labs and other data and code, so you can also get it from there.\n\nThe resulting HTML file can be viewed at https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projA-sample-proposal-431-2022, which may be easier for you to read and will also show you what your final result should look like.\n\n\n\n\nYour proposal (R Markdown and HTML file) should be submitted to Canvas.\nBe sure that your proposal includes your name (names if you are working with a partner) as the author in R Markdown.\nIf you are working with a partner, exactly one of you should submit the materials to Canvas, and the other partner should submit a text document (Word or PDF is fine) to Canvas that reads: “My name is [YOUR NAME]. I am working on Project A with [INSERT FULL NAME OF YOUR PARTNER], and they will submit the materials for the proposal.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the deadline, the TAs and Dr. Love will review your submissions quickly to ensure that your proposed plan meets the requirements for this project, and either approve the plan, or request changes.\nIf changes are requested, you’ll have a very short time window (at most 24 hours) to make those changes and resubmit until your plan is, eventually, approved.\nSuccessful completion of the proposal by the deadline will receive full credit (25 points.)\n\nProposals that require revisions after the deadline will lose 10% of the possible credit for each revision.\n\nPlease meet the deadline, and don’t wait until the last minute to do the work.\n\nTo encourage an early start, proposals submitted prior to Monday 2021-10-03 at noon will be reviewed quickly by Dr. Love and the TAs, and if a redo is required, you’ll hear back quickly enough that you should be able to accomplish it before the final proposal deadline, and thus still have a chance to earn full credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe complete proposal is submitted on time.\n\nOn time for the initial submission means R Markdown and HTML on Canvas by the deadline on the Course Calendar. If it’s late, it will lose credit for that (2.5 points out of 25), and be reviewed last.\nIf you worked with a partner, both names are in the author section of the R Markdown and HTML submitted by one of you, while the other submitted a note to Canvas meeting the specifications described in the Project A instructions.\nWhen we run the R Markdown file, does it produce the HTML file without errors? (Note: warnings or messages are OK at this stage, but it has to work.)\n\nThe YAML in the R Markdown file produces what we want in the HTML\n\nThere’s a real title that does not include Project A or Proposal and that is correctly spelled, and fits in the available space in the HTML.\nThe author name(s) appears in the HTML correctly.\nThe date is properly formatted in the HTML (achieve this most easily by using the r Sys.Date() command within the date section of the YAML as Dr. Love does in his work.)\nThere is a table of contents (doesn’t have to float, although we prefer this) which appears in the HTML and has section names that are appropriately and automatically numbered.\n\nTo achieve this, use number_sections: TRUE in the YAML.\n\nThe easiest approach to accomplish all of this is to use the readthedown template as Dr. Love did in the Example.\n\nThe project ingests the data properly.\n\nEliminating the correct row (in any way that works), and\nUsing read_csv() to read in the data, thus creating a tibble\n\nAll section headings are correctly numbered and formatted, and describe effectively the contents of the material contained in that section.\n\nReusing Dr. Love’s headings from the example proposal is a good option, but it’s OK if you want to take a different approach, so long as we can find everything.\nAgain, you need to be using toc: TRUE and number_sections: TRUE in your YAML if you are building an html_document and not using the readthedown template that Dr. Love used in his example.\nIf you’re using the readthedown template, then you need number_sections: TRUE, but not toc:TRUE since that will be done automatically by the readthedown template.\n\nYou have an attractively formatted, readable codebook that looks nice in your HTML.\n\nThe example proposal provides an example, but you can come up with something better if you like. It must be run within R Markdown though - you cannot submit an image instead of getting the codebook through code.\n\nWhich states were chosen is clear, and there is a sentence about why they were chosen.\n\nThere must be 4-6 states, including Ohio\nThis must lead to 200-400 counties, and this number must be clear from the document (both the number of rows in the final tibble and in writing.)\nYou should not drop any counties from any of the states you selected in the development of your tibble.\n\nYour selected five variables are clear, and there is information about what the variables mean and why you chose them, and the role they will play in your eventual analyses\n\nYou clearly specify which of your 5 variables is the outcome\nYou clearly specify which variable will be treated as a binary categorical variable, and which will be treated as a multi-categorical variable, specifying how many categories will be used, and why you made the choices you did about splitting those variables into categories.\nFor each of your quantitative variables (outcome and the two predictors) you specify their units in appropriate language drawn from the measure specifications at County Health Rankings.\nYou specify all variables using the name you will use in your final tibble, the vXXX code from the original data, and show that you have some understanding of what the variable means, how it was collected and why it is important in your sentences surrounding your codebook.\nYou have eleven variables in total in your tibble.\n\nThe results of your missingness check and your # of distinct values check are clear, and meet the specifications described in the instructions.\n\nYou’ve written a sentence (at least) in response to the results of each check that makes sense.\n\nYou’ve printed your final tibble by typing in its name, and it appears as a tibble.\nHmisc::describe results for your final tibble including 11 variables, with minimum and maximum values that make sense, and that show the correct number of counties and states.\nYour response to question 5 is a paragraph (or more) written in English, with attention paid to grammar, syntax and spelling.\n\nIt is clear to us what your biggest issue was, and how you tried to address it.\n\nThere is a Session Information section at the end of the document.\n\nThis should indicate that R version 4.2.1. or later is used.\n\nYou don’t have more than 3 spelling, typographical or grammatical errors in the document as a whole that we catch."

    "text": "Dr. Love and the TAs will review your proposal and either ACCEPT it or ask for a REDO.\n\nACCEPT means you’re done, and should move on the rest of Project A, perhaps while making some small changes that we request of you in your submission on Canvas.\nREDO means you’ll need to fix the problems we’ve identified (plus make sure you’ve done all of the things on this checklist) and resubmit by the deadline we give you.\n\nIf your proposal is accepted on the initial submission and was on time, you’ll receive 25 points.\nIf your proposal is accepted on the first REDO (submission 2), you’ll receive 22.5 points.\nIf your proposal is accepted on the second REDO (submission 3), you’ll receive 20 points.\nWe hope we won’t have to go further than 3 attempts for anyone.\n\n\nIf you don’t have some feature that we “prefer” we may mention this and ask you to fix it in the final version of the complete Project A, but that alone wouldn’t necessitate a REDO."
