# Now Available

## Project A Proposal

1. The **sample proposal** using 2019 data is available now. The Quarto file is called `431-projA-sample-portfolio.qmd` and it is part of the regular downloads of data and code at our [431-data site](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data). I would start by looking at the [HTML result we've posted to RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projectA-sample-proposal).

2. The **proposal template**, which we used to build the sample proposal, is also available as part of [the 431-data site](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data). It is called `431-projA-portfolio-template.qmd`. The [HTML version is also at RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projectA-proposal-template).
