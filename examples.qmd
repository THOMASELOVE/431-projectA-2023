# Now Available

## Project A Proposal

1. The **sample proposal** using 2019 data is available now. The Quarto file is called `431-projA-sample-portfolio.qmd` and it is part of the regular downloads of data and code at our [431-data site](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data). However, I might start by looking at the posted [HTML result](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/projectA-sample-proposal) at RPubs, which should be easier to read.

2. The **proposal template**, which we used to build the sample proposal but which has less information in it, as a result, is also available as part of [the 431-data site](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data). It is called `431-projA-portfolio-template.qmd`.

# Coming Soon

To come:

1. Sample Analyses

    - Template for Portfolio Report
